# v6 orchestration state

- state: running
- phase: C03 BLOCK; awaiting append-only failed-candidate disposition correction
- branch: `v6/bench-portfolio-review`
- worktree: runtime-local `.worktrees/v6-review` (uncommitted parent location)
- green base SHA: `01f01d3c5f9c00a046edd43707db75ce1426c0e8`
- reviewed predecessor SHA: `c2968ed02047370329b0cc64683e60a3358afffa`
- current attempt: 3
- failure signature: resolved by per-pick event-loop yields in heavy test drivers; synchronous
  production driver remains behavior-identical
- blockers: C03 publishes a do-not-promote candidate as supported schema-v2 guidance and removes accepted C02C bounds
- verification: focused gate green; build/typecheck/lint green; pipeline 146 passed; engine Ruff
  green and 4,123 passed / 1 skipped / 1 expected failure
- next action: preserve C03 experiment evidence; require C03A unsupported consumer disposition and accepted-C02C behavior retention
- external authority: no push, merge, PR, release, protected-branch edit, or branch deletion

The 25 files between the reviewed predecessor and baseline belong to the separately landed
intelligence subsystem. They do not overlap the v6 bench surfaces.
